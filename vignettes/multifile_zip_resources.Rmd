```

When a resource is a ZIP file containing multiple files, the result is a named list. For example, the dataset on the [Annual Summary of Reportable Communicable Diseases](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/annual-summary-of-reportable-communicable-diseases/):

```{r setup}
library(opendatatoronto)

summary_diseases <- search_packages("Annual Summary of Reportable Communicable Diseases") %>%
  list_package_resources() %>%
  get_resource()

str(summary_diseases, max.level = 1)
```

To access a single file, you can pull out the element by name:

```{r}
summary_diseases[["RatesbyDisease2007_2017.csv"]]
```
